4 Engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .	
3 A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .

1 Low rent from frame one .	
0 A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .	
1 Even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .	
3 In questioning the election process , Payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the Iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box .

1 the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility	
0 Fred Schepisi 's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen .

1 The characters never change .

2 The next big thing 's not-so-big -LRB- and not-so-hot -RRB- directorial debut .	
1 An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .	
0 After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .	
3 Deserves a place of honor next to Nanook as a landmark in film history .	
3 Blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances .	
1 Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .	
0 The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film .	
1 Once again , director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .	
4 An intoxicating experience .	
4 Armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect Forster to the always hilarious Meara and Levy , Like Mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud .	
3 A well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity .	
3 This is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its Freud and knows its Sade .	
2 A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .	
1 At a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .

1 But it was n't .	
1 Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh .	
1 That 's because relatively nothing happens .	
0 Unfortunately , it 's also not very good .	
3 Credit director Ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic .

1 The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -LRB- or cinema seats -RRB- .	
1 The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch , but a great movie it is not .	
1 In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition	
0 ... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .

4 Hard , endearing , caring , warm .	
1 This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .	
1 This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie I 've seen this summer .

2 Really dumb but occasionally really funny .	
0 A full-frontal attack on audience patience .	
3 Rarely , a movie is more than a movie .	
2 Ong chooses to present Ah Na 's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character 's blank-faced optimism .	
3 Ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of Chinese ` cultural revolution . '

4 Entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately ... dare I say , entertaining !

3 ... an interesting slice of history .	
2 Try Hell House , which documents the cautionary Christian spook-a-rama of the same name .	
3 Although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , Dogtown and Z-Boys has a compelling story to tell .	
3 Oh , look at that clever angle !

2 The strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film .	
3 Peter Jackson has done the nearly impossible .	
0 `` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .	
1 While Solondz tries and tries hard , Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .

1 Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of Scarface or Carlito 's Way .	
3 Takashi Miike keeps pushing the envelope : Ichi the Killer	
2 is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .	
1 Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .	
3 While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .	
2 It bites hard .	
0 It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .	
1 Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .	
0 The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .	
0 Collateral Damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it were n't .	
2 So brisk is Wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe .

3 Good-naturedly cornball sequel .	
0 Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .	
4 The immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary Space Station 3D .

4 He nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race .	
3 Otto-Sallies has a real filmmaker 's eye .	
4 Gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways .	
0 Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it .	
2 It may even fall into the category of Films You Love to Hate .	
2 A highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world .	
2 Sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to Frida Kahlo as if her life did , too .	
1 The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .	
3 Brosnan is more feral in this film than I 've seen him before and Halle Berry does her best to keep up with him .	
1 Forget the Psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo n't seem like such a bore .

0 Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .	
0 Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .	
4 It 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn .	
0 If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then Blood Work is for you .	
3 An amused indictment of Jaglom 's own profession .	
1 Does n't really add up to much .	
3 Confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of Barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture .	
3 The concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers .	
1 An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .	
4 Although What Time offers Tsai 's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films .	
4 The artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from Japan , the characters move with grace and panache .	
1 Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .	
2 ... the picture 's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine .	
1 The mystery of Enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .	
1 Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .	
1 Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .

3 A perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy .

1 Animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots .	
1 Devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered CGI effects .	
4 Fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , Narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it .	
0 What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .	
2 An uplifting drama ... What Antwone Fisher is n't , however , is original .	
2 At its best -LRB- and it does have some very funny sequences -RRB- Looking for Leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be .	
2 Confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis .	
0 ... a bland murder-on-campus yawner .	
2 Veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .	
3 It 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal .	
1 And adults will at least have a dream image of the West to savor whenever the film 's lamer instincts are in the saddle .	
1 Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .	
1 It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .	
0 For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .	
4 The ingenuity that Parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of Wilde himself .	
3 It 's stylishly directed with verve ...	
3 A penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination .	
3 It 's not like having a real film of Nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .	
3 This kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes Shanghai Ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors .	
3 But it does have one saving grace .	
1 He thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject .	
3 Probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent .	
4 Twenty years later , E.T. is still a cinematic touchstone .	
4 That rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film .	
3 I loved the look of this film .	
1 Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .	
3 By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .	
1 Too intensely focused on the travails of being Hal Hartley to function as pastiche , No Such Thing is Hartley 's least accessible screed yet .	
1 It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .	
2 It 's tough being a black man in America , especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .	
3 Nohe 's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : He is n't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction .	
3 An uncomfortable experience , but one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from American cinema .	
3 Its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work .	
0 It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name .	
3 The film 's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it 's propelled by the acting .	
4 Director Nancy Savoca 's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could .	
3 A very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be .	
4 A comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .	
3 Beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images .	
0 The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .	
1 A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing .	
0 The rest of the film ... is dudsville .	
4 Nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .	
1 The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .	
4 Sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .	
2 Bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .	
3 A very funny romantic comedy about two skittish New York middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles .	
3 There are moments of hilarity to be had .	
3 Like The Rugrats movies , The Wild Thornberrys Movie does n't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome .	
2 Proves mainly that South Korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their Hollywood counterparts .

3 ` Film aficionados can not help but love Cinema Paradiso , whether the original version or new Director 's Cut . '	
3 Even with all its botches , Enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment .	
3 It 's a testament to De Niro and director Michael Caton-Jones that by movie 's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all .	
0 Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .	
2 Basically , it 's pretty but dumb .	
1 Imperfect ?	
3 It asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up .	
2 It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .	
3 Tres Greek writer and star Nia Vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script .	
2 Slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .	
0 What you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height .	
1 This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .	
4 Gangster No. 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults .	
2 Massoud 's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner -LRB- and ultimately the victim -RRB- of history .	
1 This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .	
2 De Niro cries .	
4 The movie is well crafted , and well executed .	
3 If you grew up on Scooby -- you 'll love this movie .	
3 Japanese director Shohei Imamura 's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime .	
1 Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .	
3 Gooding is the energetic frontman , and it 's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences .	
3 Even if you do n't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why .	
2 I ca n't remember the last time I saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there 's only one problem ... it 's supposed to be a drama .	
0 It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .	
3 It celebrates the group 's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what Hibiscus grandly called his ` angels of light . '	
3 While the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you wo n't care .	
3 Always destined to be measured against Anthony Asquith 's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation .	
3 Like The English Patient and The Unbearable Lightness of Being , The Hours is one of those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right .	
1 Woody , what happened ?	
3 A weird little movie that 's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern L.A. 's show-biz and media subcultures .	
1 Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .	
1 Romething 's really wrong with this ricture !	
3 Much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments ...	
2 The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .	
3 Wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message .	
3 The movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the Cotswolds .	
1 A standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for De Niro 's participation , would have likely wound up a TNT Original .	
3 The huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent .	
1 The film is flat .	
3 It 's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought .	
4 A thought-provoking picture .	
3 Shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral .	
3 The magic -LRB- and original running time -RRB- of ace Japanimator Hayao Miyazaki 's Spirited Away survives intact in BV 's re-voiced version .	
0 Far too clever by half , Howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .	
1 The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .	
3 You walk out of The Good Girl with mixed emotions -- disapproval of Justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions .	
3 Watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown .	
1 Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a Pandora 's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .	
3 Some remarkable achival film about how Shanghai -LRB- of all places -RRB- served Jews who escaped the Holocaust .	
0 Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .	
3 Writer \/ director M. Night Shyamalan 's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable .	
1 Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .	
2 Ah , what the hell .

1 Murphy and Wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .	
3 A macabre and very stylized Swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters .	
1 While the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour TV documentary .	
1 ... although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired .	
2 It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .	
3 A film with a great premise but only a great premise .	
0 It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .	
0 And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .	
3 Children and adults enamored of all things Pokemon wo n't be disappointed .	
3 It lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho .

1 In between all the emotional seesawing , it 's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived .	
4 Great over-the-top moviemaking if you 're in a slap-happy mood .	
0 This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience .	
0 Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .	
2 Oozes condescension from every pore .	
0 I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?	
3 The film is delicately narrated by Martin Landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by Dana Janklowicz-Mann .	
3 Roman Polanski 's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than ` Shindler 's List ' - it is more than merely a Holocaust movie .	
3 Russian Ark is a new treasure of the Hermitage .	
2 Nair does n't use -LRB- Monsoon Wedding -RRB- to lament the loss of culture .	
1 Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .	
0 Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free .	
3 Sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative .	
4 Like The Full Monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll .	
0 An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .	
4 Informative , intriguing , observant , often touching ... gives a human face to what 's often discussed in purely abstract terms .	
0 None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .	
2 For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable .	
1 Simplistic , silly and tedious .	
3 Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .	
1 Almost peerlessly unsettling .	
1 While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .	
4 A compelling pre-WWII drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message .	
1 A battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .	
2 The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .	
4 Everyone 's insecure in Lovely and Amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships .	
3 No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .	
4 A witty , low-key romantic comedy .	
0 A dull , dumb and derivative horror film .	
4 ... a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing .	
3 None of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting is n't , either , and you would n't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ?	
2 Not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by The Piano Teacher .	
3 While the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .	
1 Nothing too deep or substantial .	
2 Even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it does n't make for completely empty entertainment	
0 Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .	
2 If the very concept makes you nervous ... you 'll have an idea of the film 's creepy , scary effectiveness .	
1 Something must have been lost in the translation .	
1 An admitted egomaniac , Evans is no Hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of Don Simpson .	
4 The unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing Kaufman has carved from Orleans ' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality .	
3 You live the mood rather than savour the story .	
3 Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .	
2 Halloween : Resurrection is n't exactly quality cinema , but it is n't nearly as terrible as it cold have been .	
1 A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .	
4 The mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs .	
4 What results is the best performance from either in years .	
1 The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .	
2 Observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout Maelstrom .	
1 Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .	
0 There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .	
3 That ` Alabama ' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of Witherspoon -LRB- who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate -RRB- ...	
2 Cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy .	
1 Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .	
4 A touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by Michel Piccoli .	
4 When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini , Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game .	
4 Manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting .	
2 Shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams , trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies .	
4 Adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel .	
2 Life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why .	
2 A lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman 's point-of-view .	
2 modeled	
4 There are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .	
1 If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .	
2 It arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications .	
3 A complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son 's home after decades away .	
0 The acting is n't much better .	
2 The date movie that Franz Kafka would have made .	
4 An enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we 've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar .	
3 Now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made Vittorio De Sica proud .	
1 ... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .	
1 There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .	
0 The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .	
1 And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest .	
2 The results , if not memorable , are at least interesting .	
1 To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .	
1 ... Pray does n't have a passion for the material .	
4 It may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made .	
1 Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .	
0 It 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .	
1 In the wrong hands , i.e. Peploe 's , it 's simply unbearable	
3 What sets it apart is the vision that Taymor , the avant garde director of Broadway 's The Lion King and the film Titus , brings .	
1 The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard -LRB- which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog -RRB- is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered .	
2 A canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a London sociopath who 's the scariest of sadists .	
1 Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .	
1 Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .	
1 Director Elie Chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?	
0 The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .	
0 A movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you ca n't wait to see end .	
1 A Blair Witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .	
1 The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .	
2 Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .	
2 From beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film .	
3 Like Mike is n't going to make box office money that makes Michael Jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience -LRB- young Bow Wow fans -RRB- - with nothing but net .	
0 Behind the glitz , Hollywood is sordid and disgusting .	
1 Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .	
1 There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .	
3 For more than two decades Mr. Nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity .	
1 Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .	
1 A moving picture that does not move .	
3 A remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point .	
1 Spain 's greatest star wattage does n't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy .	
4 One of the finest , most humane and important Holocaust movies ever made .	
3 Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .	
4 This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .	
1 It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .	
0 A Rumor of Angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .	
0 This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .	
1 The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .	
0 My only wish is that Celebi could take me back to a time before I saw this movie and I could just skip it .	
2 It 's exactly what you 'd expect .	
2 Like its predecessor , it 's no classic , but it provides a reasonably attractive holiday contraption , one that families looking for a clean , kid-friendly outing should investigate .	
3 Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .	
3 Both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , What Time Is It There ?	
1 I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .	
2 That is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .	
3 As simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine .	
4 Serious and thoughtful .	
3 It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .	
1 Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .	
0 It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .	
1 One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .	
3 An off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world .	
4 Ms. Seigner and Mr. Serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters .	
2 Unfortunately , neither Sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .	
4 A shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown .	
2 Frank McKlusky C.I. is that movie !	
0 Crummy .	
1 If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .	
2 You might say Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-Kieslowski a pun as possible .	
1 One suspects that Craven endorses They simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison .	
0 The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .	
0 Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .	
3 The subtitled costume drama is set in a remote African empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow .	
2 Rob Schneider , Dana Carvey and Sarah Michelle Gellar in The Philadelphia Story ?	
1 The film has -LRB- its -RRB- moments , but they are few and far between .	
1 Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .	
1 Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .	
1 It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .	
1 If you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !	
3 The film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .	
2 The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .	
1 Lookin ' for sin , American-style ?	
1 Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .	
1 I 'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - Arnold is not , nor will he be , back .	
3 The ingenious construction -LRB- adapted by David Hare from Michael Cunningham 's novel -RRB- constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism	
1 Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .	
2 Many of Benjamins ' elements feel like they 've been patched in from an episode of Miami Vice .	
1 If you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .	
1 Written , flatly , by David Kendall and directed , barely , by There 's Something About Mary co-writer Ed Decter .	
3 I admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for Vincent 's complaint .	
1 The most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine .	
0 Director Douglas McGrath takes on Nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading .	
0 Nothing about this movie works .	
1 The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .	
2 Bang !	
0 Too bad none of it is funny .	
1 Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .	
2 Buries an interesting storyline	
1 But it 's hardly a necessary enterprise .	
3 The Four Feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes .	
3 What makes it worth watching is Quaid 's performance .	
0 No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .	
4 An effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work .	
3 One of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace .	
1 This cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell .	
1 Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on `` The Simpsons '' has .	
3 Competently directed but terminally cute drama .	
4 So beautifully acted and directed , it 's clear that Washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses .	
3 More sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are ... an amusing little catch .	
3 ... a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations .	
2 There is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film Oscar : Make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture .	
2 A pure participatory event that malnourished intellectuals will gulp down in a frenzy .	
3 The film 's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter .	
0 The secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again .	
0 Ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok .	
3 A dashing and absorbing outing with one of France 's most inventive directors .	
0 Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .	
2 Recoing 's fantastic performance does n't exactly reveal what makes Vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat .	
2 It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .	
3 ... quite endearing .	
4 Schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film 's present with the playful paranoia of the film 's past . '	
2 No matter how firmly director John Stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make .	
3 The plot twists give I Am Trying to Break Your Heart an attraction it desperately needed .	
3 As Antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion .	
4 Beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .	
1 A sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away .	
2 The film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in .	
4 Davis ... gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft Ally McBeal-style fantasy sequences .	
2 This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now .	
3 Huppert 's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling Kathy Baker 's creepy turn as the repressed mother on Boston Public just as much as 8 Women 's Augustine .	
4 Very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .	
3 As relationships shift , director Robert J. Siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc .	
3 There 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all .	
0 Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents	
1 The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .	
1 Humor in I Spy is so anemic .	
4 If you 're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse .	
4 It will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face .	
4 An exhilarating experience .	
4 The strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting .	
1 No new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .	
3 Rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid ...	
3 Her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks .	
4 The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .	
1 Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .	
3 Functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing .	
2 Certainly .	
2 Well , it 's not as pathetic as The Animal .	
2 Not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .	
4 The kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away .	
4 It turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning .	
1 Noyce 's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , Hollywood moments to keep us	
3 The picture 's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed .	
3 The new Insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities .	
2 Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , Who Is Cletis Tout ?	
1 What 's worse is that Pelosi knows it .	
3 A bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that French realism .	
0 Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .	
3 A portrait of hell so shattering it 's impossible to shake .	
2 This is NOT a retread of `` Dead Poets ' Society . ''	
1 Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .	
1 Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more .	
2 near the end takes on a whole other meaning .	
3 Cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer .	
1 The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .	
1 As a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .	
4 Shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .	
3 I like it .	
2 John Carlen 's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling .	
2 Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .	
1 Cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .	
3 Filmmakers David Weissman and Bill Weber benefit enormously from the Cockettes ' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home .	
3 This is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem .	
1 There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .	
2 Ultimately , Jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with .	
2 The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .	
2 You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .	
3 The sword fighting is well done and Auteuil is a goofy pleasure .	
3 The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .	
2 Just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .	
3 Until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , Wendigo , Larry Fessenden 's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films .	
3 Nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining .	
2 Was I scared ?	
2 It is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by Southern blacks as distilled through a Caucasian perspective .	
2 As self-aware movies go , Who is Cletis Tout ?	
3 Manages to delight without much of a story .	
1 Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance .	
2 A fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to Betty Fisher and left out the other stories .	
0 Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets finds a way to make J.K. Rowling 's marvelous series into a deadly bore .	
3 -LRB- Barry -RRB- gives Assassin a disquieting authority .	
3 I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .	
1 Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .	
3 Some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time .	
1 Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .	
3 Another love story in 2002 's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre .	
4 A whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking Christian-themed fun .	
0 We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .	
4 Mr. Caine and Mr. Fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances .	
2 The warnings to resist temptation in this film ... are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean .	
3 A deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession -- one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom .	
1 Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .	
2 A glorious mess .	
0 The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .	
0 The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .	
0 Features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .	
3 So fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated .	
1 Everything 's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .	
0 Terrible .	
2 Would I see it again ?	
2 The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .	
3 Smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise .	
3 Wang Xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men .	
0 Rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .	
2 There 's no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane .	
3 Unlike most surf movies , Blue Crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave .	
4 Move over Bond ; this girl deserves a sequel .	
3 -LRB- P -RRB- artnering Murphy with Robert De Niro for the TV-cops comedy Showtime would seem to be surefire casting .	
4 At once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .	
3 If you can push on through the slow spots , you 'll be rewarded with some fine acting .	
1 Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .	
1 A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level .	
1 Two-bit potboiler .	
0 What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .	
3 With an expressive face reminiscent of Gong Li and a vivid personality like Zhang Ziyi 's , Dong stakes out the emotional heart of Happy .	
0 It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .	
1 an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades	
0 The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .	
1 A disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .	
4 The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .	
3 It challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should .	
4 More concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , Soderbergh 's Solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .	
3 Jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you 're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging .	
1 No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .	
3 Michel Piccoli 's moving performance is this films reason for being .	
0 ... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .	
1 Some episodes work , some do n't .	
4 Mr. Koshashvili is a director to watch .	
1 Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .	
1 The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .	
2 As directed by Dani Kouyate of Burkina Faso , Sia lacks visual flair .	
2 A plodding look at the French Revolution through the eyes of aristocrats .	
1 An absurdist spider web .	
0 The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .	
4 The asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of Jia with his family .	
2 Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .	
4 A special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of Memento ...	
3 Much of what we see is horrible but it 's also undeniably exceedingly clever .	
0 Before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end .	
2 The sound of GUNFIRE and cell phones RINGING .	
1 We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .	
2 We get an image of Big Papa spanning history , rather than suspending it .	
4 It 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .	
1 Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .	
0 It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .	
3 Even when he 's not at his most critically insightful , Godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work .	
3 May be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done .	
3 It treats Ana 's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film .	
1 It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .	
1 The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	
3 After an uncertain start , Murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with Bullock 's memorable first interrogation of Gosling .	
2 Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .	
1 The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .	
3 It may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding .	
3 The auteur 's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug .	
2 Call this The Full Monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux .	
3 It 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet I found it weirdly appealing .	
2 Indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild .	
1 This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .	
1 -LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .	
1 Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .	
4 In a summer of clones , Harvard Man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects .	
0 Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .	
2 It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .	
4 A tremendous piece of work .	
3 A hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life .	
0 Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .	
1 Writer-director Stephen Gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the English call ` too clever by half . '	
2 The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .	
2 Children of the Century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers .	
0 It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .	
2 The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .	
0 Generic thriller junk .	
2 Director-writer Bille August ... depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey Martin 's deterioration and Barbara 's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger .	
2 The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . '	
3 The level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we 've long associated with Washington the actor .	
0 From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten	
4 Time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness .	
1 Snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .	
3 Like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls .	
3 As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .	
3 Strange and beautiful film .	
1 It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .	
3 The film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet .	
3 It 's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years , and Chaykin and Headly are priceless .	
3 Surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and I shamelessly enjoyed it .	
2 Bacon keeps things interesting , but do n't go out of your way to pay full price .	
2 Red Dragon makes one appreciate Silence of the Lambs .	
1 You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .	
2 There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .	
3 A lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world .	
0 Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .	
3 Unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from France .	
0 As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .	
4 ... a true delight .	
3 Unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling .	
2 Melodrama with a message .	
3 The unexplored story opportunities of `` Punch-Drunk Love '' may have worked against the maker 's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer\/director Anderson .	
0 After you laugh once -LRB- maybe twice -RRB- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .	
1 For all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .	
3 The re-release of Ron Howard 's Apollo 13 in the IMAX format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages .	
4 Duvall is strong as always .	
1 These are textbook lives of quiet desperation .	
2 To work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer .	
3 Proves a servicable World War II drama that ca n't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem Hollywood too long has ignored .	
0 It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .	
1 The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .	
0 The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .	
2 Oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition .	
0 Plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .	
2 Same guy with both hats .	
1 A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .	
2 The tonal shifts are jolting , and though Wen 's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive .	
2 This film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers .	
4 10 minutes into the film you 'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away .	
0 My own minority report is that it stinks .	
1 Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .	
2 The movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .	
2 It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .	
3 You 'll know a star when you see one .	
3 Caruso sometimes descends into sub-Tarantino cuteness ... but for the most part he makes sure The Salton Sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty .	
1 Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .	
4 Provides the kind of ` laugh therapy ' I need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending .	
1 Take Care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length .	
0 The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing .	
1 The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .	
3 A sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old Welsh boy more curious about God than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter .	
3 Paul Bettany is cool .	
4 Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .	
2 They should have found Orson Welles ' great-grandson .	
1 Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .	
1 That frenetic spectacle -LRB- on the TV show -RRB- has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the Girls ' big-screen blowout .	
2 All Analyze That proves is that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .	
1 Zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a	
4 A work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry .	
1 Naipaul fans may be disappointed .	
1 But I had a lot of problems with this movie .	
1 When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '	
0 This 90-minute dud could pass for Mike Tyson 's E !	
0 ... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .	
2 Real Women Have Curves does n't offer any easy answers .	
0 Merely -LRB- and literally -RRB- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .	
2 Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .	
3 Another entertaining romp from Robert Rodriguez .	
3 Skins has a desolate air , but Eyre , a Native American raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor .	
0 It 's just merely very bad .	
1 We just do n't really care too much about this love story .	
3 The movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing .	
4 It 's a masterpeice .	
4 One of the greatest films I 've ever seen .	
0 Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture	
3 Rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of Yiddish culture and language .	
2 The film 's only missteps come from the script 's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of Abagnale 's antics .	
2 Like these Russo guys lookin ' for their Mamet instead found their Sturges .	
2 If this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .	
2 It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .	
1 Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .	
3 Expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women .	
4 There 's no reason to miss Interview with the Assassin	
0 It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars	
4 Every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you 're on the edge of your seat .	
2 It 's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes .	
3 There is no denying the power of Polanski 's film ...	
1 Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .	
3 But that they are doing it is thought-provoking .	
4 She may not be real , but the laughs are .	
0 Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .	
2 The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .	
1 Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .	
2 It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .	
1 prechewed	
1 Glizty but formulaic and silly ... Cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .	
2 The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .	
3 Boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing .	
0 Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .	
4 A graceful , moving tribute to the courage of New York 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice .	
0 We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .	
3 Much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of Stuart and Margolo .	
1 It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .	
0 Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley 's breasts -- is authentic .	
3 It 's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience .	
2 -LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .	
1 The film 's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature\/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality .	
3 A quaint , romanticized rendering .	
2 There 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .	
1 Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .	
1 -LRB- Tries -RRB- to parody a genre that 's already a joke in the United States .	
3 In its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .	
1 ... expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .	
3 A winning and wildly fascinating work .	
3 Though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation .	
3 As a kind of colorful , dramatized PBS program , Frida gets the job done .	
1 The gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .	
3 The picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came .	
2 ... a fairly disposable yet still entertaining B picture .	
2 Whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama is n't much of a mystery , unfortunately .	
3 The action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the Star Wars series .	
2 I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .	
1 ... instead go rent `` Shakes The Clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance .	
2 In its own way	
1 There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .	
0 This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .	
2 A perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .	
1 It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .	
0 But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences	
3 A thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy .	
1 The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .	
3 Much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be .	
3 An edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch .	
1 One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .	
4 Thumbs up to Paxton for not falling into the Hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer .	
1 Bad company .	
2 A Lifetime movie about men .	
2 Who is this movie for ?	
1 An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .	
1 ... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .	
2 Few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director Neil Burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering Barry 's terrific performance .	
0 Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .	
2 In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .	
1 The makers of Mothman Prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .	
0 Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .	
4 One of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved .	
0 Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on	
0 A chiller resolutely without chills .	
0 It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .	
3 Rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results .	
2 Expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished .	
1 Forgettable , if good-hearted , movie .	
2 Dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit	
1 Even kids deserve better .	
0 The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
